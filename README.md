# DIT
The primary target users of DIT are field scientists focuses on the collection of in situ data in the field.  The initial focus is on permafrost scientists who collect borehole data, but the full target user group is all field scientists.  One secondary target user group of DIT is modelers who use data for model input or validation.  The initial focus is on permafrost modelers, but the full target user group is the entire physical modeling community.  Another secondary target user group is non-discipline scientists, who are analyzing data collected by others in a different scientific discipline.

All users face the exact same problem: how to process data into a structure and format so that they can use it.  The data can come from multiple sources with different data structures, units and nomenclature.  Each user application is unique, so how they process the data is also unique.  The time and effort required to process data is the single largest barrier to data reuse.
